# math_solver
Uses speech recognition and the wolfram alpha API to take in speech and solve math problems. 

In order for this to work you need to install pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, pyaudio, and wolframalpha with pip install.

If you get an error installing pyaudio, use 'pip install pipwin' then use 'pipwin install pyaudio'
